Project Background / Client Requirements
business:
• wants to maintain a collection of products and couriers.
• When a customer makes a new order, it needs to create this on the
system.
• I need to be able to update the status of an order i.e: preparing,
out-for-delivery, delivered.



How did I meet the client brief? (UNDERSTANDING CLIENT SPECIFICATION/REQUIREMENTS)

The system displays a menu of options
    - products menu
    - couriers menu
    - orders menu

There is an option to exit / return to main menu.
It can handle invalid input

It can CREATE new product:
The user can enter a new product name
                     new product price
and the new product is added to the products list .


The system also can update the product, 
                - update with new name
                - update its price
and be able to delete the product if for example it has discontinued, you no longer sell it.


The system can list all the couriers they have at the moment with their name and phone numbers.
             - you can add a new courier with name and phone number
which is then added to the couriers list.

The system can also update the couriers information such as their name and phone number, for example, if the phone number of the courier has changed.

It also allows to delete the courier, so if the courier has left or is no longer working.


The system can CREATE ORDER ,with name, address,phone number,
        -allowing to add products items
        - choose the courier
which then goes to the orders list.

You also can change the status of the order from preparing, to out for delivery or delivered.

The system allows the user to update their order, such as their name, address, phone number 
it then gets added to the orders list

Finally, you can also delete the order.






What did I most enjoy implementing? 

I enjoyed implementing, the products order menu options, to create a new product with their name and price, editing the product , delete the product and then be able to go back to the main menu.

whereas the other parts started getting familiar to this, as practising over and over made me understand deeper.

There are some parts where a little mistake can actually totally change the functionality. But by looking over and over again, I finally managed to implement the system according to its requirement.
